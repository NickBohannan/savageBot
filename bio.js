module.exports = "Randall Mario Poffo was born in Columbus, Ohio. Savage was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals organization as a catcher out of high school. He was an alumnus of Southern Illinois Universityâ€“Carbondale. Savage first broke into the wrestling business in 1973 during the fall and winter of the baseball off season.  His first wrestling character, The Spider, was similar to Spider-Man. He later took the ring name Randy Savage at the suggestion of his longtime friend and trainer Terry The Goose Stephens and Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) booker Ole Anderson, who said that the name Poffo did not fit someone who wrestled like a savage."
